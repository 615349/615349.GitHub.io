[My repo](https://github.com/615349/615349.GitHub.io) has two branches: `main` and `gh-pages`. The `main` branch will contain the React app's source code, while the `gh-pages` branch will contain the built result of the React app.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploy the code in build


### `git add & git commit & git push`

Push the code to main branch
